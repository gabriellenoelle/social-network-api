# Social Network API <br/><br/>
I was tasked with building a back-end from scratch. Specifically, the task was to create an API for a Mongoose/MongoDB/Express social media application. <br/><br/>
# User Story <br/><br/>
* AS A social media startup<br/>
* I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database<br/>
* SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data <br/><br/>

# Main Technologies Utilized<br/><br/>
* MongoDB (NoSQL)<br/>
* Express<br/>
* Mongoose<br/>
